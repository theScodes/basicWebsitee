            I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on
            algorithms and networks, the roles they play in large-scale social
            and information systems, and their broader societal implications. My
            work has been supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young
            Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard
            Foundation Fellowship, a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan
            Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and
            grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the
            ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of the National Academy of Sciences,
            the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of
            Arts and Sciences.

        In Spring 2022, Karen Levy and I are teaching Choices and Consequences
        in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an
        introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of
        ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information

        a Highly Connected World. Cambridge University Press, 2010s
        <ul>
          <li>
            This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach
            entitled Networks. The book, like the course, is designed at the
            introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To
            support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented
            with optional advanced sections.

        <ul>
          <li>
            This book is based on the undergraduate algorithms course that we
            both teach. We also use the more advanced parts for our graduate
            algorithms course.
